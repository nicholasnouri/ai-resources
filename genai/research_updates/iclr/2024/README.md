The proposed approach, named D3G, stands for Domain Relation-based Domain-specific Generalization. Unlike existing methods that aim for a single domain-invariant model, D3G leverages domain similarities based on domain metadata to learn domain-specific models. During training, D3G learns a set of training-domain-specific functions, and during testing, it reweights them based on domain relations obtained from domain metadata. The paper provides theoretical proof that using domain relations for reweighting achieves stronger out-of-domain generalization compared to conventional averaging approaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets for tasks such as temperature regression, land use classification, and molecule-protein binding affinity prediction demonstrate that D3G consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. | Task Specific LLMs |
